# Algo-HackSeries2025
Project Title: Women Safety & Empowerment Platform (Blockchain-based SOS System)
Technology: React Native (mobile), React.js (dashboard), Algorand (via AlgoKit SDK), Node.js/Python backend

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a decentralized emergency alert and support platform that empowers women by enabling them to send tamper-proof SOS alerts in real-time. The platform leverages Algorand blockchain to ensure immutability, trust, and transparency in reporting, while incentivizing NGOs and volunteers via token-based rewards.

1.2 Scope

The system will:

Allow women to send instant SOS alerts with location and optional voice/video evidence.

Store all alerts on the Algorand blockchain for immutability.

Provide real-time dashboards for NGOs, volunteers, and authorities to monitor and respond.

Reward responders with Algorand-based tokens.

Support multilingual UI and offline-first functionality.

The solution will be open-source, scalable, and community-driven.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

The platform consists of:

Mobile App (React Native): Used by women to send SOS alerts.

Web Dashboard (React.js): Used by NGOs/authorities to monitor alerts and respond.

Backend API (Node.js/Python): Manages user authentication, Algorand smart contract calls, notifications.

Blockchain Layer (Algokit SDK + Algorand): Stores immutable emergency alerts & manages incentives.

2.2 User Classes & Characteristics

Women Users: Primary users, need simple, fast, and reliable UI.

NGOs/Volunteers: Responders, need verified data, maps, and communication tools.

Authorities/Admins: Require access to all reports, escalation options, analytics.

2.3 Operating Environment

Mobile App: Android (min SDK 24), iOS (min iOS 12).

Web Dashboard: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.

Backend: Deployed on cloud (AWS/GCP/Render).

Blockchain: Algorand Mainnet/Testnet via AlgoKit SDK.

3. System Features
3.1 SOS Alert (Mobile App)

Trigger Mechanisms: Tap button, double-tap screen, or shake gesture.

Data Captured: Location, timestamp, optional voice/video.

Blockchain Storage: Alert stored immutably via Algorand smart contract.

Notifications: Alert sent to guardians, NGOs, and local volunteers.

3.2 Volunteer/NGO Dashboard

View real-time map of active SOS alerts.

Accept/respond to cases (recorded on-chain).

Access user verification & communication tools.

Earn token incentives for verified responses.

3.3 Authority/Admin Dashboard

Access all alerts in system.

Escalate to police/emergency services.

Download blockchain-verified reports.

View analytics (hotspots, repeat incidents).

3.4 Token Incentives

Volunteers earn reward tokens for responding.

Token transactions logged via Algorand smart contracts.

4. Functional Requirements

User Registration & Login (via email/phone + blockchain wallet integration).

Send SOS with one tap/gesture.

Store SOS alert immutably on Algorand blockchain.

Real-time notifications to guardians/NGOs.

Map visualization of alerts.

Respond to SOS (volunteers/NGOs).

Reward distribution through Algorand tokens.

Multilingual support (English, Hindi initially).

Offline-first support (cache & sync when online).

5. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: SOS alert should be sent in <2 seconds.

Reliability: 99.9% uptime for backend.

Scalability: Support 100k+ active users.

Security: End-to-end encryption for communication.

Blockchain Immutability: All records are tamper-proof.

Usability: Simple UI with large SOS button.

6. External Interfaces

Mobile Interface: React Native app for end-users.

Web Interface: React.js dashboard for NGOs/authorities.

APIs: REST/GraphQL APIs for backend communication.

Blockchain Interface: AlgoKit SDK â†’ Algorand smart contracts.

Third-Party: Maps API (Google Maps/Mapbox), Firebase (push notifications).

7. Future Enhancements

AI-based threat prediction using hotspot analytics.

Integration with IoT wearables (smart bands, panic buttons).

Automatic voice-based SOS trigger using speech detection.

DAO-based community governance model for safety networks.
